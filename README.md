## Overview

A simple yet effective project that displays a QR Code with a short description. This project helped me practice layout structuring, responsiveness, and clean code integration.

## My process

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5 markup**
- **CSS3 (Flexbox + Media Queries)**
- **React.js** for component-based structure
- **Mobile-first workflow**

---

### What I learned

This project reinforced my knowledge in:

- Using **Flexbox** for simple yet powerful layout structuring.
- Improving **component-based development** in **React**.
- Writing **clean and maintainable code**.

#### Some code snippets I'm proud of:

```jsx
function QrCodeCard() {
  return (
    <div className="codeQrCard">
      <Qrcodemage />
      <DescriptionOfQrCode>
        <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
        <p>
          Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level.
        </p>
      </DescriptionOfQrCode>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---
### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Implement **smooth animations** when hovering over the QR Code.
- Add **light and dark mode support** for better accessibility.
- Deploy more projects using **GitHub Pages or Vercel**.
